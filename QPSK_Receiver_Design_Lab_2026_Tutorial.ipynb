In class, we will walk through the process to create the IQ samples of the transmitted signal, and then transmit this signal (via the Shout measurement framework) on POWDER over the air, while receiving it at another node. With the recorded received signal, you will perform the reception in this jupyter notebook / Google colab.\n",

Here we use a kaiser filter designed for our sampling and symbol rates.  Since our symbol rate is 1/8 of the sample rate, our cutoff should be more than 1/8."

        "0. Quiet: We put 1024 zeros (complex values 0+i0) into the transmitter signal to send first.  This is so that if the receiver starts several samples late, or if the receiver must drop a certain number of samples in order to make sure that its queue is clear from the last sampling, we can still get the start of the packet.  Also it is useful to see periods of low power before a packet starts, it makes seeing the packet in signal plots easier.\n",
        "1. Preamble: The preamble is used to give the receiver time to perform frequency and symbol synchronization.  In our transmitted signal, the preamble is 16 repetitions of the bits [1, 1, 0, 0].  Because we're using QPSK (with 2 bits per symbol), these are two symbols that are opposite in phase.  The preamble is thus a total length of 64 bits or 32 symbols.\n",
        "2. Sync Word: The sync word is sent next, it is set of a pseudo random bits that allows the receiver to know exactly when the data bits start.  It does not know this from the preamble because sometimes the receiver misses the start of the preamble, so it can't count on the preamble having exactly 32 symbols.\n",

This  frequency offset is observed in the received signal at this point -- its phase rotates over time, a full rotation every 1/Δf. Essentially, our desired received signal is multiplied by exp(j2πΔfnT), where exp() is the exponential function, j is the imaginary number, n is the sample number, and T is the sample period. Most receivers estimate Δf and multiply the signal by exp(-j2πΔfnT) to undo the problem. A typical frequency offset is on the order of a few kHz (1000 Hz).\n",

Sometimes, though, there is a problem and it is not working. It is a good idea to estimate the frequency offset, to make sure. If the frequency offset estimate is on the order of 10 Hz or less, the time sync is almost certainly working (and the non-zero estimate is just because of noise). If the frequency offset is on the order of kHz, then one or more of the nodes is not frequency synched."
